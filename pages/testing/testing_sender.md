## Testing approach ##

Message senders will need to verify as part of the development process that messages being created are valid - meet the requirements as stated in this specification for the use case in question.

NHS Digital will provide a "synthetic receiver" solution which will act as follows:

- A message sender sends a message to specific MESH mailbox ID which NHS Digital will provide
- This message arrives at the test mailbox and is picked up and validated by a FHIR Message validation tool. 
- Validation outputs is sent as a report to the message sender detailing any issues found with the message.
- [TODO  - When the MESH Endpoint lookup service is used - how will test mailbox be targeted?]
- [TODO  - How is the report delivered? Email, MESH. How is this recipient address identified from the incoming message?]
- Where the message has requested acknowledgements, the message validation tool will generate these responses as exemplars [Is this true?]

The validation report will indicate conformance to the specification at the following levels:
1. MESH / ITK requirements
2. Payload specific requirements
