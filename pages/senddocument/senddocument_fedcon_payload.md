Please refer to [Send Document - Payload structure](senddocument_payload) for a summary of the payload structure which SHALL be used to fulfil the "Send Federated Consultation Summary" use case.

The following sections describe the resources which form the payload. I.e. the resources which will be present as entries of the [ITK-Payload-Bundle](https://fhir.nhs.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/ITK-Payload-Bundle-1) resource which acts as a container for the payload. 

A [message example](senddocument_payload) is provided which illustrates these requirements to aid understanding.

## Task resource ##

The [HL7 FHIR Task](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/task.html) resource is used.

A Task resource SHALL be present in the payload, and the following elements SHALL be present in the resource:

| Task resource element	| Description   |
|------|-------------|
| intent | Fixed value : *plan* |
| status | Fixed value: *requested* |
| priority | Fixed value: *routine*. This is the same value specified in the [ITK3 message header](senddocument_fedcon_itk3) |
| description |	Summary of request in the following text: *Federated GP consultation summary for patient {Patient Name} , NHS Number {NHS Number}, with details of the encounter at practice {ODS Code}* |
| for | Reference to Patient resource profiled to [https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Patient-1) in the payload |
| authoredOn | The date/time when the message was generated. (A separate process such as the MESH client may be responsible for sending the message at a later date/time.) |
| requester.agent | Reference to federated practice Practitioner resource profiled to [https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Practitioner-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Practitioner-1) in the payload. |
| requester.onBehalfOf |Reference to federated practice Organization resource profiled to [https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1) in the payload. |
| owner | Reference to registered practice Organization resource profiled to [https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1](https://fhir.hl7.org.uk/STU3/StructureDefinition/CareConnect-Organization-1) in the payload. |
| input	| **Federated Encounter Summary** <br/>The input element MUST contain a federated encounter summary PDF document which is expressed as a input instance of type Attachment. Here `input.type.text` MUST be a fixed value of "Federated Encounter Summary", and `input.value.contentType` MUST be set to a fixed value of "application/pdf". The PDF binary data MUST be included in the `input.value.data` element in base 64 encoded format. <br/> <br/> **Additional input elements**<br/>The payload MAY also contain additional binary documents each expressed as an additional instance of the task.input element where `input.value[x]` is of type Attachment. For each such instance, `input.type.text` SHALL contain text which acts as a label for the binary attachment(e.g. "ECG data"), and `input.value.contentType` SHALL define the content type of the attachment. <br/> <br/>Where the creation date of an attachment differs from that of the message, this SHALL be specified in the `input.value.creation` element.  |
