The message given below arises from the following fictional scenario:

*Mr Richard Smith has attended an out-of-hours appointment at Cumbria Starling Medical Centre where he saw Dr Pritchard. His registered practice, Osprey Medical Centre is part of a federation which includes Starling, and the federation has set up a rotating out-of-hours evening surgery which runs one night per week. This week's out-of-hours appointments were provided by Starling.*

*After the consultation, the clinical system used by Cumbria Starling Medical Centre sends a message to the clinical system used by Osprey with details of the consultation, in order that Mr Smith's care record is updated.*
