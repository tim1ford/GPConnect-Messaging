Please refer to [Integration to MESH](integration_mesh.html) for an introduction to the use of MESH for GP Connect Messaging use-cases

## MESH Message Routing ##

All messages sent through this use case SHALL use MESH automated message routing in order to ensure that the message is routed correctly to the registered practice of the patient.

Please refer to [Integration to MESH](integration_mesh.html) for details of how to use this facility.

## Workflow Groups and Workflow ID ##

Each instance of a Send Federated Consultation message MUST include the following MESH Workflow ID in the MESH message metadata: `TBC:WorkflowID`

Each instance of an acknowlegement message generated as a result of receipt of a Send Federated Consultation message MUST include the following Workflow ID in the MESH message metadata: `TBC:WorkflowID_ACK`

### MESH client configuration 

When using the MESH client to send a message to the MESH server, the `.CTL` file MUST contain metadata about the message

| Metadata item | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| From_DTS | Identifies the MESH mailbox ID of the sender of the message – in this case the federated GP practice  |
| To_DTS |  The To_DTS field will contain NHS Number, DOB and Surname of the patient delimeted by the underscore character ‘_’. This enables automatic routing of the message to the registered GP MESH mailbox. |
| Subject | To contain the following text: <br/>  <br/>  *Federated GP consultation summary for patient {Patient Name} , NHS Number {NHS Number}, with details of encounter which at practice {ODS Code}* |

An example `.CTL` file is given below for a Federated Consultation Summary message regarding a consultation which took place for a fictional patient Mr Richard Smith, NHS Number, Date of birth 9th January 1955.

```

### MESH API configuration ###

The [MESH API Send Message](https://nhsconnect.github.io/spine-mesh/develop_mesh_server_api.html#send-message) API call will be used by a practice API client to send a message to the MESH server. MESH metadata items are defined in HTTP header fields.

| HTTP Header field | Description |
| ------------- | ----------- |
| Mex-From | Identifies the MESH mailbox ID of the sender of the message – in this case the federated GP practice  |
| Mex-To |  The To_DTS field will contain NHS Number, DOB and Surname of the patient delimeted by the underscore character ‘_’. This enables automatic routing of the message to the registered GP MESH mailbox. |
| Mex-Subject | To contain the following text: <br/>  <br/>  *Federated GP consultation summary for patient {Patient Name} , NHS Number {NHS Number}, with details of encounter which at practice {ODS Code}* |
